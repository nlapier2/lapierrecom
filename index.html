					<p class="standardParagraph"><h4>
						I am a student at George Mason University majoring in Applied Computer Science with a concentration in Software Engineering, and I am currently expecting to graduate in December 2015. My interests include web development, mobile development, secure software development, and project management.
						<br><br>
						I'm passionate about developing software, and I've worked on a number of projects outside of school that I'd like to share! I own and manage a DigitalOcean webserver that hosts this site and a couple of other projects that I've worked on. One such project was Nanbendo, which revolved around mobile game development. We pushed out one game, "Jumpy Deer", to the Google Play Store. I have also recently been excited to attend a number of "hackathons", events where undergraduate students create new software in small teams in 24 or 36 hours. I've been to hackathons at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (HackNC), University of Maryland at College Park (Bitcamp), and Virginia Tech (VTHacks). At VTHacks, my team won a top 5 award out of over 40 submissions. Applications I have worked on at hackathons include a schedule organizing utility (SchedSync), a Google Chrome browser extension that manages tabs (TabULater), and a site where college students can post anonymous thoughts about university life (cnfsr, pronounced "confessor"). To see some of the projects I've worked on in more detail, use the navigation bar at the top of the page.
						<br><br>
						You can find most of the projects I've worked on via <a href="https://github.com/nlapier2">my GitHub profile</a>. Some, like cnfsr, are not visible, because the code isn't public. You can see the cnfsr site at <a href="http://www.cnfsr.com">cnfsr.com</a>; however, the site currently does not enable posting, as the backend is currently being modified. You can see my hackathon submissions on <a href="http://challengepost.com/users/nlapier2?ref_content=user-portfolio&ref_feature=portfolio&ref_medium=global-nav">my ChallengePost page</a>. You can <a href="Nathan's Resume 2014.pdf">view my resume here</a> and you can <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=347989470&trk=spm_pic">view my LinkedIn here</a>. I currently have a 3.93 GPA, have won a merit scholarship, and am a member of my university's honors college and Student Run Computing and Technology (SRCT) club. I have multiple years of industry experience developing secure software, and have also held a position as Teaching Assistance for a Computer Science course. I am skilled in Java, Python, and C, and I also have some knowledge of web languages such as HTML, CSS, Javascript, and jQuery. I am familiar with both Windows and Linux operating systems, as well as the popular version control tool Git. You'll notice that a lot of the projects I've worked on have been in small groups; I love working with teams of committed developers to create software faster and better than one person can. Of course, you can see my full list of skills on my resume! If you would like to contact me, I prefer emails at nathanl2012@gmail.com, but I am also available by phone (my number is on my resume). Thank you for visiting my website!
