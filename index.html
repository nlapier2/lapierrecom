				<p><h4>
					I am a student at George Mason University majoring in Applied Computer Science with a concentration in Software Engineering, and I am currently expecting to graduate in December 2015. My interests include web development, mobile development, secure software development, and project management.
					<br><br>
					I'm passionate about developing software, and I've worked on a number of projects outside of school that I'd like to share! I own and manage a DigitalOcean webserver that hosts this site and a couple of other projects that I've worked on. One such project was Nanbendo, which revolved around mobile game development. We pushed out one game, "Jumpy Deer", to the Google Play Store. I have also recently been excited to attend a number of "hackathons", events where undergraduate students create new software in small teams in 24 or 36 hours. I've been to hackathons at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (HackNC), University of Maryland at College Park (Bitcamp), and Virginia Tech (VTHacks). At VTHacks, my team won a top 5 award out of over 40 submissions. Applications I have worked on at hackathons include a schedule organizing utility (SchedSync), a Google Chrome browser extension that manages tabs (TabULater), and a site where college students can post anonymous thoughts about university life (cnfsr, pronounced "confessor"). To see some of the projects I've worked on in more detail, use the navigation bar at the top of the page. You can also use the navigation bar to find links to my Resume, GitHub, LinkedIn, and ChallengePost, and to find my contact information. Once again, thank you for visiting my website!

				Cnfsr (pronounced "confessor") is a site that I worked on at VTHacks, an event at Virginia Tech in which undergraduate students in small teams created new software in 36 hours. The idea of cnfsr was inspired by so-called College Confessions websites. In such websites, students from a given college or university can post anonymous "confessions" about the college or about their life. The problem is, these sites are very unorganized; some of them are just facebook pages run by an anonymous student at the institution. Another issue is that these anonymous confessions are entrusted to some student running the site, so there isn't much privacy.
				<br><br>
				That's where cnfsr comes in. Cnfsr is intended to be a central hub for college confessions. The site is aiming to be much more centralized and organized than the individual confessions sites that currently exist. It will also protect the privacy of its users, and not force them to submit messages via facebook (which reveals their identity) to some college student running a confessions page.
				<br><br>
				Cnfsr has been taken off of the web, as the backend is currently being modified. The website was originally written in HTML, CSS, Javascript, and PHP, but the PHP backend is currently being switched over to a different language. Cnfsr took home a top 5 award out of over 40 submissions at VTHacks.

				TabULater is a project that I worked on at Bitcamp, an event at the University of Maryland in which undergraduate students in small teams created new software in 36 hours. The inspiration for TabULater came from the fact that my friends and I always had numerous browser tabs open, and it became difficult to see which one was which after a while. I wanted some easy way for the browser to keep track of all the tabs I had open so that I could close most of them and focus on the ones I needed in the immediate moment. I also wanted a way to add tabs to that list that I thought I might want to have open later. Likewise, I wanted to be able to remove tabs that I no longer cared about.
				<br><br>
				TabULater is a Google Chrome browser extension that helps the user manage browser tabs. The user opens the extension, which loads up the tabs they already have open and presents them as a list of links. The user can then close any of their open tabs, because the links are stored in the extension and the user can reopen one of the tabs from the extension if they want. The user can also store a link to any url of their choosing by entering it in the text box. The list of tabs can be customized by closing any of the links in the extension using the "X" icons next to the links. TabULater is a fun and useful utility for Google Chrome browser users.
				<br><br>
				TabULater is now open source. The source code can be seen on <a href="https://github.com/nlapier2/TulExtension">my GitHub page</a>. TabULater was written in HTML, CSS, and Javascript/jQuery. It is not currently available on the Google Play Store, because the project is still under development.

				Nanbendo is a project that I worked on with a friend of mine independently of any official event. With the goal of gaining knowledge of mobile development technologies and web languages (which I was unfamiliar with at the time), we started developing under the name "Nanbendo" (short for "Nathan and Ben do"). We initially focused on developing games on mobile platforms, but decided to also work on web applications.
				<br><br>
				Our biggest accomplishment under this name was creating a mobile game called "Jumpy Deer", which the screenshots on the left show. Jumpy Deer is a simple game in which the user taps the screen to have the deer jump over logs and avoid birds as many times in a row as they can. Jumpy Deer was made for android and is now <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.BenjaminWardandNathanLaPierre.JumpyDeer&hl=en">available on the Google Play Store</a>. It has garnered over 100 downloads and holds a 4.5/5 star rating. We also made all of the art for the game from scratch.
				<br><br>
				Additionally, I designed a logo and created a website for Nanbendo. The website was one of my first forays into web languages, and was coded completely from scratch in HTML and CSS. It is comprised of several different pages that describe what Nanbendo is, what our current and future projects are, and what is coming soon. Nanbendo is now defunct, and we have decided to move on to bigger and better things. Nanbendo was a fun experiment and a great learning experience, but we are now looking to develop more professional quality apps. Still, I learned a lot from Nanbendo and Jumpy Deer, including gaining experience with Android and honing my HTML and CSS front end skills.
