					<p><h4>
						I am a student at George Mason University majoring in Applied Computer Science with a concentration in Software Engineering, and I am currently expecting to graduate in December 2015. My interests include web development, mobile development, secure software development, and project management.
						<br><br>
						I'm passionate about developing software, and I've worked on a number of projects outside of school that I'd like to share! I own and manage a DigitalOcean webserver that hosts this site and a couple of other projects that I've worked on. One such project was Nanbendo, which revolved around mobile game development. We pushed out one game, "Jumpy Deer", to the Google Play Store. I have also recently been excited to attend a number of "hackathons", events where undergraduate students create new software in small teams in 24 or 36 hours. I've been to hackathons at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (HackNC), University of Maryland at College Park (Bitcamp), and Virginia Tech (VTHacks). At VTHacks, my team won a top 5 award out of over 40 submissions. Applications I have worked on at hackathons include a schedule organizing utility (SchedSync), a Google Chrome browser extension that manages tabs (TabULater), and a site where college students can post anonymous thoughts about university life (cnfsr, pronounced "confessor"). To see some of the projects I've worked on in more detail, use the navigation bar at the top of the page.
						<br><br>
						You can find most of the projects I've worked on via <a href="https://github.com/nlapier2">my GitHub profile</a>. Some, like cnfsr, are not visible, because the code isn't public. You can see the cnfsr site at <a href="http://www.cnfsr.com">cnfsr.com</a>; however, the site currently does not enable posting, as the backend is currently being modified. You can see my hackathon submissions on <a href="http://challengepost.com/users/nlapier2?ref_content=user-portfolio&ref_feature=portfolio&ref_medium=global-nav">my ChallengePost page</a>. You can <a href="Nathan's Resume 2014.pdf">view my resume here</a> and you can <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=347989470&trk=spm_pic">view my LinkedIn here</a>. I currently have a 3.93 GPA, have won a merit scholarship, and am a member of my university's honors college and Student Run Computing and Technology (SRCT) club. I have multiple years of industry experience developing secure software (mostly in Python), and have also held a position as Teaching Assistance for a Computer Science course. I am skilled in Java, Python, and C, and I also have knowledge of web languages such as HTML, CSS, Javascript, and jQuery, as well as Bootstrap. I am familiar with both Windows and Linux operating systems, as well as the popular version control tool Git. You'll notice that a lot of the projects I've worked on have been in small groups; I love working with teams of committed developers to create software faster and better than one person can. Of course, you can see my full list of skills on my resume! If you would like to contact me, I prefer emails at nathanl2012@gmail.com, but I am also available by phone (my number is on my resume). Thank you for visiting my website! Scroll down or use the navbar to see some of the projects I've worked on in more detail.

				Cnfsr (pronounced "confessor") is a site that I worked on at VTHacks, an event at Virginia Tech in which undergraduate students in small teams created new software in 36 hours. The idea of cnfsr was inspired by so-called College Confessions websites. In such websites, students from a given college or university can post anonymous "confessions" about the college or about their life. The problem is, these sites are very unorganized; some of them are just facebook pages run by an anonymous student at the institution. Another issue is that these anonymous confessions are entrusted to some student running the site, so there isn't much privacy.
				<br><br>
				That's where cnfsr comes in. Cnfsr is intended to be a central hub for college confessions. The site is aiming to be much more centralized and organized than the individual confessions sites that currently exist. It will also protect the privaxy of its users, and not force them to submit messages via facebook (which reveals their identity) to some college student running a confessions page.
				<br><br>
				Cnfsr is currently up at <a href="http://www.cnfsr.com">cnfsr.com</a>, but it currently has some of its main features disabled, as the backend is currently being modified. The website was originally written in HTML, CSS, Javascript, and PHP, but the PHP backend is currently being switched over to a different language. Cnfsr took home a top 5 award out of over 40 submissions at VTHacks.

				TabULater is a project that I worked on at Bitcamp, an event at the University of Maryland in which undergraduate students in small teams created new software in 36 hours.
				<br><br>
				TabULater is a Google Chrome browser extension that helps the user manage browser tabs. The user opens the extension, which loads up the tabs they already have open and presents them as a list of links. The user can then close any of their open tabs, because the links are stored in the extension and the user can reopen one of the tabs from the extension if they want. The user can also store a link to any url of their choosing by entering it in the text box. The list of tabs can be customized by closing any of the links in the extension using the "X" icons next to the links. TabULater is a fun and useful utility for Google Chrome browser users.
				<br><br>
				TabULater is now open source. The source code can be seen on <a href="https://github.com/nlapier2/TulExtension">my GitHub page</a>. TabULater was written in HTML, CSS, and Javascript/jQuery. It is not currently available on the Google Play Store, because the project is still under development.

				Nanbendo is a project that I worked on with a friend of mine independently of any official event. With the goal of gaining knowledge of mobile development technologies and web languages (which I was unfamiliar with at the time), we started developing under the name "Nanbendo" (short for "Nathan and Ben do").
				<br><br>
				Our biggest accomplishment under this name was creating a mobile game called "Jumpy Deer", which the screenshots on the left show. Jumpy Deer is a simple game in which the user taps the screen to have the deer jump over logs and avoid birds as many times in a row as they can. Jumpy Deer was made for android and is now <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.BenjaminWardandNathanLaPierre.JumpyDeer&hl=en">available on the Google Play Store</a>. It has garnered over 100 downloads and holds a 4.5/5 star rating.
				<br><br>
				Additionally, I designed a logo and created a website for Nanbendo, <a href="http://www.nanbendo.com">nanbendo.com</a>. The website was one of my first forays into web languages, and was coded completely from scratch in HTML and CSS. It is comprised of several different pages that describe what Nanbendo is, what our current and future projects are, and what is coming soon. While the Nanbendo project is not entirely defunct, we have decided to move on to bigger and better things. Nanbendo was a fun experiment and a great learning experience, but we are now looking to develop more professional quality apps. Still, I learned a lot from Nanbendo and Jumpy Deer, including gaining experience with Android and honing my HTML and CSS front end skills.
